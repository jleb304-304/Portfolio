# About Me
Hi! My name is Jacob LeBlanc, a senior at Stanford studying Computer Science in the Human Computer Interaction track. I have always really enjoyed the visualization that coding allows, which is why I chose the HCI track, but I have also recently grown to really enjoy data science and data analysis after this summer!

BudgBuds is the skeleton of a group budgeting app where I worked on many of the button components as well as creating the login screen. I was also an integral part of the entire design process and helped other members of my group as we all tried to navigate React Native for the first time. The second project is an interactive fanfiction made through Twine. This was also a collaborative process, and I was responsible for much of the storywriting as well as compiling the twine itself. This was my first time using Twine, and I am very proud of how it came out! These projects were especially difficult because they were my first two large collaborative projects for school that were remote, so the communication process was not as smooth as I would have hoped for, but I am very happy to share them both!

My most recent and impressive work is not currently approved for public release; however, I do have other work available upon request. Due to the Stanford Honor Code, I cannot post this code publicly.
Thank you so much for your consideration!
